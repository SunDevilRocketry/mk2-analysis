(19)
Script: Diameter_Ratio

Function: DiameterR(B,roe_ox,roe_f,mdot_ox,mdot_f);

B = Experimental multiplier
roe_ox = Density of oxidizer
roe_f = Density of fuel
mdot_ox = Mass flow rate of the oxidizer
mdot_f = Mass flow rate of the fuel



(20)
Script: Orifice_diameter

Function: OrificeD(Cd,mdot_ori,roe,dP)

Cd = Discharge Coefficient
mdot_ori = Mass flow rate of the orifice wanted
roe = density of fluid
dP = Pressure drop across orifice



(21)
Script: Valve_ratio_error

Function: ValveRerr(Rd,Df,Dox)

Rd = Ideal diameter ratio
Df = Diameter of fuel orifices
Dox = Diameter of oxidizer orifices



(22)
Script: Injection_velocity

Function:  InjectorVelo(mdot_ori,roe,Ao)

mdot_ori = Mass flow rate of the orifice wanted
roe = density of fluid
Ao = Area of orifice exit



(23)
Script: Momentum_per_time

Function: MomentumPer(mdot,v)

mdot = mass flow rate of orifice
v = vis
